# eCommon

This is the common repository storing common include files and common source files for all the e*Components* (like [eLog](https://github.com/X-Ryl669/eLog), [eMQTT5](https://github.com/X-Ryl669/eMQTT5), [eHTTPd](https://github.com/X-Ryl669/eHTTPd))

The basic idea for all those components is to make an efficient and as-small-as-possible software package for implementing the expected feature.
Thus this doesn't make sense not to share the same source code and to avoid multiple version of the same code in all components.

**This repository is not usable as-is, it's a dependencies of the other components.**
